## Getting to safety

The object of the game is to guide the cats to safety by creating a safe path for them to reach the door. Let's make a score variable to keep track of how many cats have successfully reached the door.

+ Create a variable called `score`.

[[[generic-scratch-add-variable]]]

+ Add some code to your cat sprite to add one to the score each time a cat reaches the door. Don't forget to also set the score to zero at the start of the game.

`If` the cat is `touching the door sprite`, then `add 1 to the score`.

Here are the new code blocks you'll need to add:

This is what your code should look like:

+ Add some more code so that a cat sprite that reaches the door makes a 'meow' sound and then disappears.
