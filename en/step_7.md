## Challenge: more obstacles

The level we have created at the moment is rather easy to win. Could you make your game harder?

+ Add more backgrounds with different platform designs.

+ Move the location of the door depending on which background is displayed.

+ Add some more sprites to represent moving obstacles. Perhaps you could have roaming dogs or rotating spikes for the cats to avoid?

+ Only allow the player to use a fixed amount of "ink" to draw extra lines on the game. You can keep track of how much "ink" is used by creating a variable and using the timer to time how long the mouse is held down.

+ Create a sprite to represent to the player how much ink they have left.
