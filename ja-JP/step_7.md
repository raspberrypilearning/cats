## チャレンジ: しょうがいぶつをふやす

今のところ、このゲームはかんたんです。 ゲームをむずかしくするアイデアはありますか？

+ Add more backgrounds with different platform designs.

+ Move the location of the door depending on which background is displayed.

+ 動くしょうがいぶつとしてスプライトを追加する。 Perhaps you could have roaming dogs or rotating spikes the cats need to avoid?

+ Only allow the player to use a limited amount of "ink" to draw lines in the game. You can keep track of how much "ink" is used by creating a timer variable that records how long the mouse is held down.

+ Create a sprite to show the player how much ink is left.
